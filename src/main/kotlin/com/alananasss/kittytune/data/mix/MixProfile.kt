/**
 * The scoring behind "start mixing" — what makes a track worth putting in front of somebody (issue #33).
 *
 * ## What was asked for, and the one clause that shapes everything
 *
 * "Add your own mix, on the main screen, above your time, just click the start mixing button, which,
 * according to your interests, gives out songs that you like **(these are not your favorite songs)**, you can
 * also customize your mix, select a genre or artist's songs, for example, in the Yeat style."
 *
 * That parenthesis is the whole specification. A mix built from what somebody has already liked is a playlist
 * of their likes, which they already have and did not ask for. What he wants is the *inference*: from what you
 * play, work out what you would play, and hand you things you have not heard. So the profile is built from
 * listening rather than from likes, and anything already liked or recently played is penalised rather than
 * rewarded.
 *
 * ## Why the profile comes from plays and not from likes
 *
 * A like is a single bit recorded once, often out of politeness to an artist, and it never decays. A play is a
 * repeated, involuntary vote: nobody plays a track forty times by accident. The stats table already records
 * every play with a timestamp and a duration, which is a far richer signal than the likes list — and it is the
 * signal that answers "according to your interests" honestly.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. The network half lives in [MixEngine]; this is the part worth testing, because a
 * recommendation engine's bugs are all in its arithmetic.

     * that is geo-restricted or taken down. [com.alananasss.kittytune.data.StreamResolver] has resolved exactly

     * decides what "restricted" means, and this only asks whether there is a way to hear it.
     *
     * What is still excluded is the case where there is no route at all: restricted *and* the YouTube fallback
     * turned off. Then nothing can play it, and a hundred-track queue nobody vetted is the one list in the app
     * that cannot afford a row that silently fails.
     *
     * The candidates themselves remain SoundCloud's alone. Only where the audio comes from may differ, which is
     * exactly the instruction: "assure-toi que tous les titres du mix viennent uniquement de SoundCloud, mais
     * l'audio tu peux mettre YouTube uniquement si c'est Go+ ou injouable."

     * twice gives two mixes.
     *
     * ## Why no artist gets three tracks in a row
     *
     * A station seeded on one artist returns that artist's whole catalogue, so the raw ranking clumps: four by
     * one act, then four by another. The pass below takes the best remaining track whose artist has not been
     * used [ARTIST_GAP] slots ago, which interleaves without reordering by anything other than score.
     *
     * Two rules, and only one of them bends. [MAX_PER_ARTIST] is hard — a mix of ten tracks by one artist is the
     * opposite of a mix, so a mix that can only continue by breaking it ends short instead. [ARTIST_GAP] is
     * soft, because a mix of twenty with one artist twice in a row beats a mix of eleven.
