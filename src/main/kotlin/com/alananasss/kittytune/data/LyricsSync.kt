/**
 * How a track's lyrics are shifted against its audio: by one offset, or by two that drift apart.
 *
 * One offset is enough when the lyrics were timed against the same recording and only start late or early.
 * When they were timed against another version (a different master, a radio edit, a slightly different speed)
 * they drift: right at the start, seconds off by the end (issue #66). Two points fix that. The offset is
 * [offsetMs] at [anchorMs] in the track and [endOffsetMs] at [endAtMs], straight in between and carried on the
 * same way before and after.
 *
 * Times are in the audio's own timeline, offsets are added to the playhead to get the lyrics' time, as with the
 * single offset before.
