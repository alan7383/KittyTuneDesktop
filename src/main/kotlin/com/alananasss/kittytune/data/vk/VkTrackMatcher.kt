/**
 * Decides whether a search result is the VK track being imported.
 *
 * Built on [LyricsMatcher]'s word similarity, which already copes with titles padded with "(Official
 * Video)" and credits in another order, but stricter than the lyrics need to be in three ways, because a
 * wrong song in a playlist is worse than a missing one:
 *
 * - **The version has to match.** LyricsMatcher drops everything in brackets, so "Song (Slowed)" and
 *   "Song" read the same — right for lyrics, which are the same words, wrong here, where a playlist of
 *   sped-up edits must not come back as the originals. VK keeps the version in its own field.
 * - **The length counts more.** Catalogue copies of one recording agree to a second or two; a gap of
 *   twenty seconds is another edit.
 * - **Script does not.** A Russian artist is "Кино" on VK and often "Kino" elsewhere, so artists are also
 *   compared transliterated.
