/**
 * A [androidx.compose.material3.Slider] that behaves at its extremities the way
 * [androidx.compose.material3.VerticalSlider] already does.
 *
 * Material 3 ships two track treatments. The one `Slider` picks by default drops the leftover
 * track stub the moment it gets shorter than its own corner radius, so the last few pixels of
 * travel make the pill pop out of existence instead of closing. The expressive overload —
 * the one `VerticalSlider` defaults to — keeps drawing it and lets the corner radius shrink with
 * it, so the stub squeezes shut and reopens smoothly. Only the second one reads as motion.
 *
 * The difference is a single flag inside the library (`enableCornerShrinking`), reachable only by
 * naming the track explicitly, which is all this wrapper does. Everything else — colours, thumb,
 * sizing, the `Dp.Unspecified` corner size that still means "half the track height" — matches the
 * default so this stays a drop-in replacement: call sites keep their signature and only their
 * import changes.
 *
 * Note that a stepped slider (`steps > 0`) opts itself back out inside the library, since ticks
 * need the track to end on a full corner. That is upstream behaviour, not a limitation here.
