 * The playhead as the seek bars draw it, moving every frame instead of in the player's steps (issue #66).
 *
 * The player reports its position four or five times a second, and the engine's own figure moves in
 * buffer-sized steps, so a bar bound straight to it advanced in visible jerks, worst in the wide full player.
 * Between reports this runs a clock at the rate the reports have been advancing at (which also covers a
 * changed playback speed), and takes up the difference to each new report a little at a time. A report far
 * from the drawn position is a seek: the bar slides there, which also makes wheel notches one smooth run.
 *
 * @param reportedMs the player's last reported position.
 * @param isRunning whether the playhead is moving: playing, and neither loading nor being dragged.
 * @param followsInput while dragging or scrubbing: draw [reportedMs] as is, no glide and no prediction.
 * @param trackKey a different track starts over from its own position (the mix glide handles that change).
