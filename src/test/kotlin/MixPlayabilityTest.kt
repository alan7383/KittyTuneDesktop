/**
 * Which candidates a mix may keep, and where their audio is allowed to come from (issue #33).
 *
 * "Les titres injouables pourquoi ils sont injouables, car c'est des titres Go+ ? Si c'est le cas pourquoi ne pas
 * faire un fallback YouTube ? […] assure-toi que tous les titres du mix viennent uniquement de SoundCloud, mais
 * l'audio tu peux mettre YouTube uniquement si c'est Go+ ou injouable."
 *
 * He was right and my first filter was wrong. `SNIP` and `SUB_HIGH_TIER` are Go+ — a real SoundCloud track whose
 * full audio needs a subscription — and `StreamResolver` has resolved exactly those through YouTube for as long as
 * the setting has existed. Excluding them threw away tracks the player would have played.
 *
 * So the rule these tests hold is the one he stated: a restricted track stays in the mix when there is a route to
 * its audio, and is dropped only when there is none. The candidates are always SoundCloud's; only the route may
 * differ.
