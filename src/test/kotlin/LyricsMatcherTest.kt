/**
 * Which provider results count as the track being played.
 *
 * What these protect: on SoundCloud the "artist" is the account that uploaded the file, so a
 * re-upload of a well known song carries an unrelated artist and a title padded with
 * `(Official Video)`-style noise. Requiring the title *and* the artist to match, then discarding
 * anything more than fifteen seconds off in duration, is what made those tracks come back with no
 * lyrics until the user edited the artist name by hand (issue #33). Loosening it too far is the
 * opposite failure — the lyrics of a different song, confidently displayed.
